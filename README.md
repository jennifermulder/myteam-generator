## Purpose
****As an employee with a busy schedule, I have created a work day scheduler that will allow me to add important events so that I can manage my time effectively. 

## Features
****This daily planner alerts the user to whether events throughout the work day are in the past, present, or future. By routinely changing color, the user is easily drawn to events that require immediate attention... without having to refresh the page!
